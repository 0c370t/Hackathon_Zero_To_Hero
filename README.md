## Preconditions

For this workshop, it is assumed that you have:
 - A working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and Javascript
	 - A basic understanding of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev); if you haven't used it before, I recommend their [excellent tutorials](https://svelte.dev/tutorial/basics). If you complete up to the end of Section 6, that should be enough to complete this workshop.

 - A basic knowledge of using a command line

Things we will cover:
 - Basic Git Version Control (see [Setting up Github](#setting-up-github), and [Gitkraken's Library of Tutorials](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials))
 - Building a functional signup / login page with [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
 - Hosting our page with [Vercel](https://vercel.com)

Please complete the items in the preconditions list to ensure you are ready for the workshop. If you have questions or something is unclear, please [file an issue](https://github.com/0c370t/Hackathon_Zero_To_Hero/issues/new).

### Setting up Github
I recommend using [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/uk5zfsbz), an excellent [git](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-download) gui that is free for open source projects.
	<small>If you choose to use Gitkraken, please ensure you sign in with your Github account, this makes working with the repository much easier.</small>

1. If you don't already have one, [create a Github account](https://github.com/signup) (We'll be using this a lot)
3. Next, set up your repository [[‚ùî]](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/tutorials/what-is-a-git-repository)
	1. [Create it on Github](https://github.com/new)
	2. [Clone](https://www.gitkraken.com/learn/git/git-clone) the repository
		1. Don't forget where this gets put on your computer
